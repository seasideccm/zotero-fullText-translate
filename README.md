## Quick Start Guide

### Install Pre-built `xpi`

See how the examples work by directly downloading the `xpi` file from GitHub release and install it to your Zotero.

This is also how your plugin will be released and used by others.

> The release do not promise any real functions. It is probably not up-to-date.
>
> The `xpi` package is a zip file. However, please don't modify it directly. Modify the source code and build it.
